UIColorExtensions
=================

This is a simple UIColor extension for Objective-C that allows you to get a UIColor from a web formatted hex value (such as, #FFFFFF).

Simply import UIColorExtensions.h into the class and use it like this:

    [UIColor colorFromHexString:@"#FFFFFF"];

Couldn't be more simple.

Enjoy!
